{"body":"# Welcome to RemainderDivision!\r\nWelcome to RemainderDivision's Github page. RemainderDivision is the site where you can divide, but using remainders instead of decimals. You can view the project on [http://remainder.eu5.org](http://remainder.eu5.org)\r\n## Use the code!\r\nYou can use the division with remainders code by downloading the file at [RemainderDivision.git/api/basic.js](https://github.com/hitecherik/RemainderDivision/tree/master/api) to divide with remainders.\r\n### Using the code\r\nTo use the code, you have to pass in two parameters - the numerator and the denominator, just like in a fraction. Please pass them in in integer form. The function returns an object, with two parameters: \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n`\r\nvar numerator = 20;\r\nvar denominator = 3;\r\nvar answer = remainder(numerator, denominator);\r\nvar result = answer.result;\r\nvar remainder = answer.modulo;\r\n`","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
